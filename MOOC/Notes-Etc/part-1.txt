Part 1 Notes



Boilerplate:

In Java, our programs have to include some boilerplate code to function. This boilerplate, an example of which is shown below,
for example tells the computer what your program is called. Below, the name of the program is Example.
This name has to correspond to the name of the file that contains the source code (e.g. Example.java).

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Text to be printed");

    }
}

The examples in the material will not always show the template, but you can assume that your program file always needs one. 



Print:

System.out.println("Print");

Also sout then (TAB)


Scanner:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Program {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a tool for reading user input and name it scanner
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Print "Write a message: "
        System.out.println("Write a message: ");

        // Read the string written by the user, and assign it
        // to program memory "String message = (string that was given as input)"
        String message = scanner.nextLine();

        // Print the message written by the user
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}


Type casting:

String valueAsString = "42";
int value = Integer.valueOf(valueAsString);

System.out.println(value);

ALSO:

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Write a value ");
        int value = Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine());
        System.out.println("You wrote " + value);
