Part 1 Notes

Boilerplate:

In Java, our programs have to include some boilerplate code to function. This boilerplate, an example of which is shown below,
for example tells the computer what your program is called. Below, the name of the program is Example.
This name has to correspond to the name of the file that contains the source code (e.g. Example.java).

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Text to be printed");

    }
}

The examples in the material will not always show the template, but you can assume that your program file always needs one.
